# Talking present

## Introduction
This is the idea of experiencing Christmas with your family, while not being together.
It's a small and lightweight mp3-player which plays random sound files.
The files are in German only and are typical sentences you hear while sitting together with your family on Christmas.
With this project, you are able to feel like you are with your family, while being in quarantine due to a pandemic.

## Software
Look into the repo's arduino folder.
The code needs two more extra libraries:
- ESP8266TrueRandom: [https://github.com/marvinroger/ESP8266TrueRandom](https://github.com/marvinroger/ESP8266TrueRandom)
- CircularBuffer: [https://github.com/rlogiacco/CircularBuffer](https://github.com/rlogiacco/CircularBuffer) (also installable via library-manager)

## Hardware
Just take a look at the schemes in the "schemes"-folder.
I've added two examples as to how you could assemble the hardware (breadboard and perfboard).
